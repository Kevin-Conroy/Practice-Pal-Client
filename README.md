# Practice Pal

https://practice-pal-client-kevin-conroy.vercel.app/

As a busy drummer & guitarist I always seem to let my practice goals slip through the cracks. Practice Pal will let you choose your instrument, and then provide a list of exercises to practice, as well as your current tempo for each exercise & your goal tempo for each exercise. You can build yourself an entire practice routine right in your profile!

<a href="https://ibb.co/wRx4tc0">Here is the welcome page that initially loads</a>

<a href="https://ibb.co/M85VBVQ">Signup/Login is simple - just a username & password is required!</a>

<a href="https://ibb.co/hLwhdhm">Once signed up users can start adding exercises</a>

<a href="https://ibb.co/n86RmGh">Once the user feels good about their progress, they can update their current & goal tempos!</a>

<a href="https://ibb.co/ZVytmGd">The user's exercise list is then updated with their latest current & goal tempo for each exercise.</a>

The client was built using React, Javascript, HTML & CSS. The API was built with Express, Node, and PostgreSQL.

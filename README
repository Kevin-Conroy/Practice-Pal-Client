PRACTICE PAL

https://practice-pal-client-kevin-conroy.vercel.app/

As a busy drummer & guitarist I always seem to let my practice goals slip through the cracks. Practice Pal will let you choose your instrument, and then provide a list of exercises to practice, as well as your current tempo for each exercise & your goal tempo for each exercise. You can build yourself an entire practice routine right in your profile!

The client was built using React, Javascript, HTML & CSS. The API was built with Express, Node, and PostgreSQL.
